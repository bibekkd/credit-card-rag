Conclusion:

Axis Atlas credit card is an excellent option for those who spend a substantial amount every month on travel as well as other expenses. The card offers 10% value-back on travel spends as reward points redeemable across 15+ airlines and hotels in 1:2 ratio. On spends beyond travel, users can get up to 4% value-back as 2 points per Rs. 100. Along with the highest conversion ratio, the card has a unique tier-based structure allowing high-spenders to extract maximum value from the card by reaching higher tiers with better benefits. However, being a travel credit card, the only disappointing bit is that this card charges a high forex mark-up fee of 3.5% and offers no concierge services.

2. Axis Bank Horizon Credit Card
Axis Bank Horizon Credit Card

Joining Fee: Rs. 3,000
Annual Fee: Rs. 3,000

Key Features and Benefits:

5,000 EDGE Miles as joining benefit and 1,500 EDGE Miles on card renewal
5 EDGE Miles per Rs. 100 spent on Travel EDGE portal and at direct airline websites/counters
2 EDGE Miles per Rs. 100 spent on other spending categories
1 EDGE Mile = 1 Partner Point
Up to 8 international airport lounge visits per year, 2 per calendar quarter
Up to 32 domestic lounge visits for Visa cardholders and up to 24 domestic lounge visits for Mastercard users every year

Conclusion:

Axis Bank Horizon Credit Card offers EDGE Miles with a 5% value-back on travel bookings and a base rate of 2% on other card spends. Though the value-back on travel spends is similar to that offered by Axis Atlas, Horizon offers this 5% rate only on Travel EDGE platform and standalone airline platforms. Axis Horizon’s EDGE Miles to travel points conversion ratio of 1:1 is quite good, but lower than Axis Atlas (1:2). Moreover, Axis Horizon offers a significantly high number of complimentary domestic lounge visits, without any spend-based condition. Substantial value-back on travel spends, lounge access and bonus EDGE Miles on renewal together make it one of the best travel credit cards in India.
